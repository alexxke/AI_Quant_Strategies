# AI_Quant_Strategies

Artificial Intelligence for Quantitative Trading Strategies approaches stock price and direction forecasting by combining smart featurization using technical indicators with machine learning approaches and a novel data segmentation strategy. We validate the performance of technical indicators by studying defensive, low-beta components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on intermediate prediction periods (5, 10, and 20 trading days).
